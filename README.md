# Socket_JSON_Packet

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use **socket programming** in C++ to exchange **JSON-based packets** between a client and a server.  
It is designed as a learning resource and testing environment for developers interested in network programming and structured data communication.

---

## 🧐 Why This Project?
- To provide a **practical example** of client–server communication.
- To show how **JSON packets** can be constructed, sent, and parsed.
- To help beginners understand the basics of **Windows socket programming**.
- To serve as a **foundation** for larger applications such as chat systems, APIs, or multiplayer games.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The **server** starts and listens on a specific port.
2. The **client** connects to the server.
3. The client sends JSON packets to the server.
4. The server receives, parses, and displays/logs the data.
